Link: https://natekhchan.github.io/moviedb/index.html

## Introduction:
This app draws inspiration from the authors, Trevin Shu and Arpad G. Bondor [Gabriel] .  This clockwork and artistry of work took about 3 weeks to fully debug and feature the final product.  Its quality is crafted solely with the tact and skills of Nathan Chan, drawing awareness to the UX / UI features of the page.  There are many features of this app.  
One of the main features of this app is allow the user to view it as a universal MOVIEDB (or movie databook).  The user is enabled to search from the Search Options sorting by the genres of univerally all the movies from old to new.  For example, movie criteria can include a mix of action, mystery and a romance.  It would deliver on the likes of the user, catered to everyone who is a movie fan.  

There are also four main pages, which to choose from: 
The categories are:
1)  Top Trending
2)  Now Playing
3)  Upcoming
4)  Top Rated

These were researched by TMDB to be the most attractive categories used by the described API set.  

The user also has the option to search 'What are you searching for?'.  This is by far the most used feature of the app.  The user can search for many descriptions of the movie, including if the user is interested in a film and would like to see it.

The app generates a gamut of options including: release date, rating out of a ten scale, runtime, genres, certification (rating), and has the top 15 casts of the flix.  It also shows whether the movie is released or not, to allow the user to make a deciding action, whether or not, to buy a ticket to see the movie, or just enjoy at home.  The budget is shown, so is the revenue.  The user can also choose from trailers to watch from, to peak their suggested interests in the film.
